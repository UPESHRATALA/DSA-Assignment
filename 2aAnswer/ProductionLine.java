//Question 2(a)
//You are the manager of a clothing manufacturing factory with a production line of super sewing machines. The
//production line consists of n super sewing machines placed in a line. Initially, each sewing machine has a certain
//number of dresses or is empty.
//For each move, you can select any m (1 <= m <= n) consecutive sewing machines on the production line and pass
//one dress from each selected sewing machine to its adjacent sewing machine simultaneously.
//Your goal is to equalize the number of dresses in all the sewing machines on the production line. You need to
//determine the minimum number of moves required to achieve this goal. If it is not possible to equalize the number
//of dresses, return -1.
//Input: [1,0,5]
//Output: 2
//Example 1:
//Imagine you have a production line with the following number of dresses in each sewing machine: [1,0,5]. The
//production line has 5 sewing machines.
//Here's how the process works:
//1. Initial state: [1,0,5]
//2. Move 1: Pass one dress from the third sewing machine to the first sewing machine, resulting in [1,1,4]
//3. Move 2: Pass one dress from the second sewing machine to the first sewing machine, and from third to
//first sewing Machine [2,1,3]
//4. Move 3: Pass one dress from the third sewing machine to the second sewing machine, resulting in [2,2,2]
//After these 3 moves, the number of dresses in each sewing machine is equalized to 2. Therefore, the minimum
//number of moves required to equalize the number of dresses is 3
